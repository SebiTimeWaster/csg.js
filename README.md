# three-csg, a CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) library for three.js

### Overview

Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) is a modelling technique that uses Boolean operations like union and intersection to combine 3D solids. This library implements CSG operations on meshes elegantly and concisely using BSP trees, and enabled you to build objects in [three.js](https://threejs.org/) with a couple lines of code.

### Notes

This is based on the excellent [jscad/csg.js](https://github.com/jscad/csg.js) library.

This is a work in progress, it does not work yet.
